A simple and elegant stopwatch application built with React. This project demonstrates the use of React hooks to manage state and side effects for time tracking.

## Features

- üïí **Start/Stop**: Begin or pause the stopwatch.
- üîÑ **Reset**: Clear the elapsed time and lap records.
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Lap**: Record lap times and display them in a list.
- ‚è≤Ô∏è **Time Formatting**: Shows time in `MM:SS.ss` format for readability.

## Usage

1. **Start**: Click the "Start" button to begin tracking time.
2. **Pause**: Click the "Pause" button to halt the timer.
3. **Reset**: Click the "Reset" button to reset the stopwatch and lap times.
4. **Lap**: Click the "Lap" button to record the current time as a lap.

## Code Overview

- **State Management**:
  - `elapsedTime`: Tracks the time that has passed since the stopwatch started.
  - `isRunning`: Boolean flag to indicate if the stopwatch is running.
  - `lapTimes`: Array to store recorded lap times.
  - `timerId`: Holds the ID of the interval timer for cleanup purposes.

- **Functions**:
  - `startStopwatch`: Starts the stopwatch and sets up the interval timer.
  - `pauseStopwatch`: Pauses the stopwatch and clears the interval timer.
  - `resetStopwatch`: Resets the elapsed time and lap times, and clears the interval timer.
  - `recordLap`: Adds the current elapsed time to the lap times list.
  - `formatTime`: Formats elapsed time into `MM:SS.ss` for display.

- **Effect Hook**:
  - Cleans up the interval timer when the component unmounts to prevent memory leaks.
